Challenge: Build a Scalable FastAPI Backend Service with PostgreSQL Integration

# Scenario:

You are tasked with building a simple backend service for managing "Projects" and their associated "Tasks". 

Each Project can have multiple Tasks.

The service should expose RESTful APIs to create, read, update, and delete Projects and Tasks. 

Additionally, implement an endpoint to retrieve all Tasks for a given Project, sorted by their priority.

# Requirements:

Backend API:

Use FastAPI to build the RESTful API.

Implement the following endpoints:

POST /projects/ - Create a new project.

GET /projects/{project_id} - Retrieve project details.

PUT /projects/{project_id} - Update project details.

DELETE /projects/{project_id} - Delete a project.


POST /projects/{project_id}/tasks/ - Add a new task to a project.

GET /projects/{project_id}/tasks/ - List all tasks for a project, sorted by priority (descending).

PUT /tasks/{task_id} - Update a task.

DELETE /tasks/{task_id} - Delete a task.



## Data Model:

Project:
    id (UUID or int)
    name (string, required)
    description (string, optional)
    created_at (timestamp)

Task:
    id (UUID or int)
    project_id (foreign key to Project)
    title (string, required)
    priority (integer, higher number = higher priority)
    completed (boolean, default False)
    due_date (date, optional)


## Database:

Use PostgreSQL for data persistence.

Design efficient schema with appropriate indexes (e.g., on project_id and priority).

Write optimized queries to fetch tasks sorted by priority.

Additional Requirements:

Use asynchronous endpoints and database calls (e.g., with asyncpg or databases library).

Validate input data using Pydantic models.

Handle errors gracefully (e.g., 404 for not found, 400 for invalid input).

Write clean, maintainable, and well-structured code.

Bonus (if time permits):

Implement simple authentication (e.g., API key header) to protect the endpoints.

Add pagination support to the GET /projects/{project_id}/tasks/ endpoint.

Constraints & Resources
Duration: 25-30 minutes.

External Resources:

Use a free PostgreSQL instance locally or via ElephantSQL (free tier).
